# Declare two variables, `x` and `y`, and assign them integer values. Swap the
values of these variables without using any temporary variable.
>>> x=10
>>> y=20
>>> print(f"Before swapping: x = {x}, y = {y}")
Before swapping: x = 10, y = 20
>>> x = y
>>> y = x
>>> print (f"After swapping: x = {x}, y = {y}")
After swapping: x = 20, y = 20

#Create a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Take the length and
width as inputs from the user and store them in variables. Calculate and display the area.
